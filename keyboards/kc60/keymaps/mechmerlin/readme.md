MechMerlin's KC60 Layout
======================

This is the 60% layout used by u/merlin36, host of the MechMerlin YouTube channel.
It has 5 layers, base QWERTY, base HHKB, FN 1, FN 2(HHKB), and an arrows only layer.

Merlin's KC60 was acquired from Massdrop: https://www.massdrop.com/buy/kc60-mechanical-keyboard and is the Co-Star stabilizer version

If you would like to program your KC60 using the manufacturer recommended approach, please follow the guide on keychatter: https://www.keychatter.com/2015/07/05/programming-the-kc60/.

## Keymap Notes
- Highly influenced by the KBP V60 and WKL B.Face standard layouts
- Does not support any form of inswitch or underglow lighting as Merlin hates them.
- Arrow toggle switch is FN + Space
- Reset is FN + R
- HHKB keymap is approximate as keyboard is not built like HHKB


### Build
To build this keymap, simply run `make KEYMAP=mechmerlin`.
