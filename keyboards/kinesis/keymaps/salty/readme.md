# Salty's Kinesis Keymap

These layouts are derived from what I was using on my Kinesis Contoured keyboards through TMK converters.  With the move to QMK through Stapelberg replacement controller, I've cleaned up the layouts a bit while adding number/symbol layer.

There are only minor changes in the base keywell layout (e.g., CapsLock is ESC, arrow clusters on one side), while the thumb clusters deviate more from the default layout.

Changes to the thumb clusters include: 
* The navigations keys moved to Fn layers.
* The function of 2u keys have been reversed - I've always used space with my left thumb, and I find it more helpful to have access to Space and Enter while using my mouse/trackball.
* Enter and Backspace have been duplicated on both clusters.
* The 2u keys serve dual function as momentary layer switchers.

I'm frequently fiddle around with the layouts as I find certain things I want to try out.
