Zen Keyboard
====

A split ergo keyboard with a few goals in mind:
 - Be as thin as possible. Other split KBs (Let's Split, Nyquist, Iris) are 15.2mm thick. The Zen is only 8.0mm thick.
 - Layout designed for gaming. 1.5u pinky keys, ortho alphas, and angled thumb keys. After trying Ortholiniear, Atreus62, and Ergodox, this is the best layout for gaming and typing.
 - RGB backlighting. 16 WS2812b LEDs shine through the perimeter switches. The SK6812 variant are cheap and easy to solder.
 - Price. Using Arduino Pro Micro, SK6812 LEDs, and PCB FR4 for the case, the cost of each half without switches or caps can be reduced to under $20 when purchased at volume.
