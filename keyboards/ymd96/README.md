YMD96 
==========================

This is a port of the QMK firmware for boards that are based on the
ps2avrGB firmware, like the [ps2avrGB
keyboard](https://www.keyclack.com/product/gb-ps2avrgb/), for use on the YMD96. 

Note that this is a complete replacement for the firmware, so you won't be
using Bootmapper Client to change any keyboard settings, since not all the
USB report options are supported.  

Here is the default layout, it is fairly simple with a few function keys:

If you have a different layout (since there were many options during the GB), please feel free to contribute!

Hardware Supported: YMD96 with the ATmega32a chip.  
Hardware Availability: The GB was run June 2017, [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/6hu3yx/vendor_ymd96_gb_is_now_live_68_an_universal_and/). The vendor has stated that they plan on selling more rounds.

## Finding your specific matrix

This firmware was modified from [ps2avrGB](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ps2avrGB), also found on this qmk repo, to work with the YMD96 keyboard. However, I only have one board to test with, which might have a different layout than yours. To get qmk working with your specific layout, you'll need to follow these steps:  

1. Follow the [guide here](https://www.massdrop.com/talk/1392/programming-kbd-keyboards-via-bootmapper-client) to get Bootmapper Client setup. While you won't need it after you get qmk working, you need to use Bootmapper Client to figure out how the matrix is laid out. In the end, here's an example of what it should look like: ![BMC](https://i.imgur.com/wNihDwn.png)  
2. Next is the tricky part: editing the `ymd96.h` file. Here, you have to figure out how the keys are laid out physically and assign each key the right keycode. Study how the codes in brackets correspond to the BMC columns. Consider the first column: K000 corresponds to Col 1 Row 1, and K100 corresponds to Col 2 Row 1. K111 = Col 2 Row 10.  
3. First, you need to define the codes that are actually used in the brackets. KC_NO is used whenever a cell isn't used, such as col 1 row 4-6 in BMC.  
4. Once you have all those set up, you need to put the keycodes where they physically are in the KEYMAP( area. Since the columns aren't all uniform (e.g. col2row6 is B, but col2row7 is the numpad 1), the keycodes will be all over the place.  
5. Finally! Hard part is pretty much done. Next, you simply have to edit the `keymap.c` file to actually assign the keycodes to do something. You essentially replace the keycodes (e.g. K000) with actual codes that do something, e.g. KC_ENTER. Modify these to your hearts content, and of course this is where all the extra functionality of QMK shines. I won't get into it here, but hopefully you've made it this far!

## Installing and Building

Since the YMD96 uses an ATmega32a chip instead of the 32u4, you need to download [HIDBootFlash v.1.0](http://vusb.wikidot.com/project:hidbootflash) for Windows. If anyone knows of a Linux/Mac bootflasher that works, edit this readme!  
On Windows, I use [MINGw](http://www.mingw.org/) to compile the keymaps. On Linux, you can simply use the terminal. 

Once you have those two pieces of software:
Build the keyboard with  
```
$ make ymd96-default  
```  
If you make your own layout, change the `default` word to whatever your layout is.  

And flash the compiled hex file with `HIDBootFlash`. Simply put the board in flashing mode by plugging it in while holding control, and click `find device`. Then you can specify the .hex file and flash it to the device. 

## Troubleshooting

From my experience, it's really hard to brick these boards. But these
tricks have been useful when it got stuck in a weird scenario.

1. Try plugging the board in while pressing `L_Ctrl`. This will force it
   to boot only the bootloader without loading the firmware. Once this is
   done, just reflash the board with the original firmware.
2. Sometimes USB hubs can act weird, so try connecting the board directly
   to your computer or plugging/unplugging the USB hub.
