## Introduction

The Monarch keyboard is a custom 60% + LHTK keyboard designed by GeekHack member **koalapear**, with electronics designed and developed by **skullydazed**.

## Firmware Features

- Supports QWERTY, Dvorak & Colemak.
- Fully-custom `Ctrl` key configuration:
    - `Caps Lock` key is mapped to `Left Ctrl` by default.
    - `Left Ctrl` key is mapped to `Ctrl+QWERTY`, regardless of layout ([Dvorak–QWERTY ⌘](https://msol.io/blog/tech/dvorak-qwerty-on-mac-windows-and-linux/)).
    - `Right Ctrl` key functions as a normal modifier when held down, and produces `Caps Lock` when tapped once.
- SpaceFn: Hold down `Space` or `Enter` to enable the HHKB-style function layer.
- Two-layer keypad [gaming overlay](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/f8d0a04a7648f5bf3d12830773421378), great for Dvorak/Colemak typists.

    - `0` or `Q`: QWERTY layout.
    - `1` or `D`: Dvorak layout.
    - `2` or `C`: Colemak layout.
    - `3` or `G`: Gaming layout (QWERTY with standard Ctrl/Caps positions; GUI keys disabled; SpaceFn disabled).
    - `Space` or `Enter`: Toggle SpaceFn layer (enabled by default).
