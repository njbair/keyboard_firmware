# /u/yanfali keymap for clueboard 60%

Almost the same as default but differs in the following ways

 1. `Caps Lock` -> `MT(KC_LCTL, KC_ESC)`.
    I'm a heavy vim user and I prefer escape to be closer than default. I also move `Control` to this key if you hold it.
 1. Switch Alt and GUI.
    I spend most of my time on OSX, so I reverse Alt and GUI to be
    more comfortable on OSX.
 1. Added a custom layer.
    I use this to map the cursor keys to WASD, the familiar directional
    gaming keys. As I use a split right shift, this naturally leads
    to the left hand being used for navigation. This is also the
    best place to add custom mappings, macros and combo keys.
