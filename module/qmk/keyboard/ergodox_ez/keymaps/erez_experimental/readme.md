# Erez's experimental layout

This is my personal layout which I use to test out ideas which may or may not make it onto the default layout we ship with. It's based off the default layout, with various tweaks.

Changelog:

## Feb 11, 2016:

* Updated ASCII legend for thumb clusters
* Made it so outer left-hand thumb key is L1 momentary toggle
* Added % and @ to L1
* Swapped positions for _ and - on L1

## Feb 5, 2016:

* A whole new design for the symbol layer. Specifically:
  * Put the minus, underscore, and semicolon right in the homerow for the right hand
  * Parens are in better places for me
  * The arrow keys now send Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn, for switching browser tabs with the arrows when in symbol layer
  * Tab (right-hand outer thumb key) now does double duty to toggle symbol layer when held down
  * Backspace (left-hand outer thumb key) now just toggles symbol layer (I wasn't using it as a backspace)
  

## Jan 19, 2016:

* Made J into dual-action key (Alt when held down), to make Alt-tab more ergonomic.
* Made ' into dual-action key (Win/Cmd when held down).
