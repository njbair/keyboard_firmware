*** ChibiOS 16.1.0 Release Notes.                                          ***
******************************************************************************

ChibiOS 16.1.0 is composed of several independent but inter-operable
sub-projects: RT, NIL, HAL.

*** ChibiOS 16.1.0 highlighs ****

This release has been developed with focus mainly on the HAL subsystem and
general STM32 support. RT and NIL received minor bug fixes that have also
been back-ported to previous stable branches.

*** ChibiOS 16.1.0 general improvements ***

- ChibiOS release version number redefined as <year>.<month>.<patch> in order
  to not confuse release version numbers with products version numbers.
- Improved ARMCMx GCC rules.ld supporting multiple RAM regions. It is now
  possible to assign stacks, data, bss, etc ot any of the defined RAM regions.
  - Added capability to allocate initialized, zeroed and not initialized data
    to any of the defined RAM regions.

*** What's new in RT 3.1.0 ***

- Support for Cortex-M7.
- Added new function chVTGetTimersStateI() returning the state of the
  timers list. This is useful to assess if it is convenient to transition
  to lower power modes.
- Added CodeWarrior compiler support to the e200 port.
- Minor bugs fixed.

*** What's new in HAL 4.0.0 ***

- New watchdog (WDG) driver.
- Added support for STM32L0xx, STM32L4xx, STM32F7xx, STM32F446, STM32F030xC,
  STM32F070x6, STM32F070xB, STM32F091xC, STM32F098xx devices.
- Improved USB driver.
  - Modified the driver to have a separate USB_SUSPENDED state, this
    allows the application to detect if the USB is communicating or if
    it is disconnected or powered down.
  - Added synchronous API.
  - Removed queued API.
  - Improved USB support for STM32 USBv1, OTGv1.
  - Isochronous support for STM32 USBv1, OTGv1.
  - STM32 USBv1/OTGv1 buffers and queues do not more require to be aligned in
    position and size.
- Improved Serial-USB driver.
  - New buffers queue object.
  - Modified the driver to reject write/read attempts if the
    underlying USB is not in active state. In case of disconnection the
    SDU driver broadcasts a CHN_DISCONNECTED event.
- Improved CAN driver.
  - Better errors reporting for STM32 CANv1.
- Improved UART driver.
  - Added synchronous API.
- Improved PAL driver.
  - Added "lines" handling to PAL driver, lines are identifiers of both
    ports and pins encoded in a single value. Added a set of macros
    operating on lines.
  - Added GPIOv3 driver for STM32L4xx.
- I2S support added for STM32 SPIv2 peripheral.
- Board files an demos for STM32 Nucleo32 boards.
- Added latest CMSIS headers for all STM32 families.
- STM32 DMA drivers have been unified and consolidated in DMAv1 and DMAv2.
  - DMA channels selection now supported on all devices with the new mux
    mechanism.
- Added serial driver support for USART 3..6 on STM32F030xC devices.
- Added support for differential mode to the STM32F3xx ADC driver.
- STM32 GPT, ICU and PWM driver enhancements. Now it is possible to
  suppress default ISRs by defining STM32_TIMx_SUPPRESS_ISR.
  The application is now able to define custom handlers if required
  or simply save space if the driver callbacks are not used.
  Now the functions xxx_lld_serve_interrupts() have global scope, this
  way custom ISRs can call them from outside the driver module.
- Added TIM units use cross-check in STM32 GPT, ICU, PWM and ST drivers,
  now use collisions are explicitly reported.
- Added support for I2C3 and I2C4 to the STM32 I2Cv2 I2C driver.
- Added support for SPI4...SPI6 to the STM32 SPIv2 SPI driver.
- Added support for UART4...UART8 to the STM32 UARTv2 UART driver.
- Added support for UART7 and UART8,LPUART1 to the STM32 UARTv2 serial
  driver.
- New STM32 ADCv3 driver supporting middle STM32 devices (F3, L4).
- New STM32 ADCv2 driver supporting large STM32 devices (F2, F4, F7).
- New STM32 ADCv1 driver supporting small STM32 devices (F0, L0).
- Introduced support for TIM21 and TIM22 in STM32 ST driver.

*** What's new in NIL 1.1.0 ***

- Support for Cortex-M7.
- Minor bugs fixed.
